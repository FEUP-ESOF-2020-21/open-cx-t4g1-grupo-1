## Product Vision

**A Simple and User Friendly App to provide the best possible hourly organization and adaptation to time table changes**

---
## Elevator Pitch
Has it ever happened to you getting to a session and finding out it was postponed?
Our app, **AdOv**, allows you to check the event schedule and it gives the staff the opportunity to change it in case of a setback, sending a notification to every user on the conference.
Enjoy the extra minutes of coffee break while still showing up on time to the next lecture! (lecture ou talk ou session ou meeting)
